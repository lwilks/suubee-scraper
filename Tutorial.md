## Edit the .env file with your Username\Password settings for IG & Suubee

In order for the script to recieve the lists from Suubee it must have the correct login details to access the site (as it is not a publicly available website).

Similarly, the script needs your IG login details as well as an API key in order to access the IG API to search for the correct stock symbols and (re)build your lists.
